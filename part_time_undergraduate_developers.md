# Part-Time Undergraduate Developers

## Program

Our goal in this program is to fully integrate Undergraduate Developers into our team. These developers will be paired with members of DLS to initially build skills and then work issues to advance our software.

## Timesheets

Undergraduate developers are paid biweekly. Timesheet and pay schedules are available on the [Payroll Cycles website](https://finance.princeton.edu/payroll-labor-accounting/payroll/payroll-basics/monthly-and-biweekly-payroll-cycles)

## Schedules

Part-time developer schedules are tracked in a shared calendar called "DRDS
Student Employees Schedule".

## Hiring and Onboarding

Relevant documentation can be found in the [Student hiring Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1MTfYgMHMb4FZpUQDqsLWasTqm6QMrdoe).
