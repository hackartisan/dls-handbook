# Technical Liaisons

DLS will designate a technical liaison to each project in the team's portfolio.

## Why Technical Liaisons

* Ensure that each of our projects are stewarded, looked over, and thought about reliably.
* Empower developers to learn deeply about the context and stakeholder use cases for a particular application.
* Act as a point of contact for the product owner to support their interactions with stakeholders.
* Bring knowledge of issues and talking points back to the team for implementation discussion and prioritization.
* Promote the needs of the application to the team to ensure it isn't lost in the shuffle.
* Product owners have told us this role is useful.

A technical liaison is not necessarily the technical authority or expert on the
codebase they steward. Technical and architectural decisions are a team effort.
