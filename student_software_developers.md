# Student Software Developers

## Program

Our goal in this program is to fully integrate undergraduate developers into our team. These developers will be paired with members of DLS to initially build skills and then work issues to advance our software.

## Student Employee Policy
There is a library-wide [Student Employee Policy](https://pulstaff.princeton.edu/working-pul/library-student-employee-policy/) on the Connecting staff Intranet site.

## Timesheets

Student Software Developers are paid biweekly. Timesheet and pay schedules are available on the [Payroll Cycles website](https://finance.princeton.edu/payroll-labor-accounting/payroll/payroll-basics/monthly-and-biweekly-payroll-cycles)

## Schedules

Student Software Developer schedules are tracked in a shared calendar called
"DLS Student Developers". DLS staff should request access to view and manage
this calendar from the manager of DLS. The account and password for this
exchange account is in LastPass under `Shared-ITIMS-Passwords/DLS/DLSStudentDevs
email`, but 2FA is set up for use by the current manager of DLS.

During the summer Student Software Developers work full-time hours. During the
school year they work part-time when classes are in session. Students can work
at other times, e.g. reading week, if desired.

Student employees accrue paid sick time and can take additional unpaid time off as
needed in communication with their supervisor.
